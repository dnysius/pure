meeting - big picture is to use SAFT with focused transducer. if this project is highly successful, then we can apply for more grants in the future.
goal today is read the papers listed in the references section of the grant paper in this order : [4] [2] [3].
other goals are: to set up the motorized transducer holder using arduino; set up angle dependence data acquisition (create a setup that is better than the previously used one).
What is B-mode imaging?
principal assumption of SAFT implementations is that the region of interest is located in the far field of the transducer. This is often not the case in NDT/NDE applications where the transducer is very close to/in contact with the surface.
two problems: diffraction effects may impair image quality, and sparse/infrequent spatial sampling may yield aliasing (misidentification of a signal frequency- introducing distortion or error) artifacts

"double path continuous time spatial impulse response (SIR)"
"spatial impulse response"
It is a well known fact in electrical engineering that a linear electrical system is fully characterized by its impulse
response as shown in Fig. 2.1. Applying a delta function to the input of the circuit and measuring its output
characterizes the system.

Dr. Xu sent thesis document. ID card works now. Met with Graham Pearson, will need to complete safety training.
Will focus on gathering data first (Ying). Will need to improve angle dependence set up, and get the transducer stage working.
angle dependence: need to find a way to stabilize the mechanism of tilting the specimen to a certain degree. currently, the specimen target center is also being elevated. i have some initial ideas for building a specimen holder which rotates about a vector that lives at the surface plane. we expect to have a curved function rather than a linear fit.
