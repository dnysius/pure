take angle dependence data for Flat and Focused transducers, but for every degree instead of every 2.
then take angle dependence data for Flat transducer with Acoustic Lens for every degree.
want to zoom into first reflected signal and observe and measure peaks (to find thickness)
1d scan per angle (20-30 datapoints for each, 100 micron steps)  and plot as array - each time series is one dimension (voltage corresponds to pixel brightness) and the transducer position is the other dimension (3 dimensions total).

find the 0 degree reading, then find the micrometer readings corresponding to 1 degree increments using the calibration curve.
measured sample depth and sample dimensions. sample depth is approx 9.7 +/- 	.3 cm

PRF 200, pulser voltage 200, Trans freq 2-2.5, Gain 25
1.00V/ vertical, 160 microseconds, zero'd horizontal & vertical, 40 000 length save

hilbert transform
calculate lobes
2f, 3f sample depth
plot on same graph
rotate sample to tilt on other side
