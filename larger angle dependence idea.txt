tape axis end of long metal sample to the table. find a wedge that is at 45 degrees.
tie long string on the other end of the sample.
pull string a little bit —> grab() and repeat until 45 degrees is reached.
you don't need curve fit, but assume that string pull is uniform each time, and use linspace to divide the range [0,45] into N datasets and analyze with the code.
the string pull is NOT uniform but with small enough steps it's fine
you will have a ton of signals, so how do you find the peak from each one efficiently? bscan is not really affected, but finding peak values of first reflected signal is HARD.
best bet might be to define a domain where the first reflected signal is located, then to take the max of the abs() and record that peak value?
even harder, to find the peaks corresponding (distinguishable) to the top and bottom surface
find noise data, find the max voltage in this range —> threshold
