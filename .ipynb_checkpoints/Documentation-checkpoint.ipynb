    "We use a protractor to measure the micrometer reading corresponding to every degree of inclination, starting at 0 degrees and going up to 15 degrees. We perform a linear fit on this data using `scipy.optimize.curve_fit()` and a linear model function $f(\\theta) = a\\theta+b$, where $\\theta$ is the angle of inclination and $f$ is the micrometer reading.\n",

Create the output directory, and create a Scope object, passing the directory (as a numpy path) as a parameter. Finally, run `scope.Scope.grab()` to make a single measurement, and the signal will be saved as an `.npy` file in the specified directory."
